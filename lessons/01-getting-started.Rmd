# Getting started

Do you smell that shiny new tool smell? It is a bit like that new car
smell. Take a moment to look around and let it all sink in.


Objectives:

* To be able to start and stop RStudio
* To be familiar with the RStudio interface
* To be able to compute simple mathematical functions interactively
* To be able assign values to variables
* To be able to install and load packages


## RStudio

Over the last several years, RStudio has become a very popular IDE (integrated
development environment) for R. In addition to interacting with the R Console,
RStudio has many extras built in including version control integration, package
building, reproducible research, de-bugging, and built-in text editor with
smart highlighting and code completion. This is the environment we will be
using for the workshop and should set you up for continued learning with R.

> ## Workshop format
>
> Through out the workshop we will alternate between me demoing things
> and you doing things yourself. Ask questions, interupt and help each
> other. Right now watch the demo, you will get a chance to do things
> as part of the challenges.

RStudio should be available from All Programs at the Start Menu on Windows. On
Mac it is in the Applications folder.

### Challenge
1. Start RStudio.
2. Find the Console Pane. Look at the Environment, History Pane. Look at
   the Files, Plots, Packages, etc. pane.


## RStudio as calculator

Using R interactively is very powerful. It allows you to go back and forth
in your analysis. It makes it very easy to try out things. I use it all the
time when exploring new data or a new visualisation.

To get familiar with using the R console let's do some basic maths:

```{r}
2 + 2
3 * 4
42 / 10
2 == 2
# more complicated math also works
```

You can also store the result of a computation in a new variable so you can
reuse it later. You can name your variables however you like. However variables
cannot start with a digit, contain spaces, or (most) special characters.
Underscores and periods are allowed. To store a value in a variable use `<-`.

```{r}
four <- 2 + 2
four
four * 3
my_name <- "Tim"
my_name
```

### Challenge
1. Compute the sum of 235 and 7568
2. Create two variables called `number1` and `number2`. Give them the values
   42 and 3 respectively.
3. Use `number1` and `number2` and maths(!) to store 126 in a variable `number3`.
4. Look around RStudio to find the "Environment" pane, can your recognise the
   variables you created?


## Extending R

Much of the power of a ecosystem like R comes from the ability to create
and use packages. Packages allow you to use programs other people wrote within
your analysis. For example we will use a package called `ggplot2` which contains
methods for plotting your data (as opposed to having to invent it all ourselves).

CRAN or The Comprehensive R Archive Network. This is where you download R
and also where most will gain access to packages. Not much else to say about
this now other than to be aware of it.

### Installing packages

When a package gets installed, that means the source is downloaded and put
into your library. A default library location is set for you so no need to
worry about that. In fact on Windows and Mac most of this is pretty automatic.

To install the `ggplot2` library run:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

> ## Prerequisites
>
> If you followed the prerequisites you should already have all the packages
> we will need installed.

Once you installed a new package you can add it to your R session with:

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

This will load the package called `ggplot2` and make its contents available for
use in your R session.

### Challenge
1. Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `rmarkdown`, `leaflet`, and
   `DT`.
2. Load the `DT` package.
